# FairAudioBench Implementation Analysis & Updates

## Key Findings from Reference Implementation Review

### 1. **Training IS Required** ✅
- The benchmark includes training models to evaluate bias across different front-ends
- However, the PRIMARY focus is on **bias evaluation**, not training new models
- Training scripts serve as **reference implementations** for researchers

### 2. **Data Structure Alignment** ✅ 
- Updated `download_datasets.py` to match reference implementation:
  - Uses Hugging Face datasets API with proper authentication
  - Extensive language support (100+ languages)
  - Proper tonal/non-tonal classification
  - Manual download instructions for restricted datasets

- Updated `preprocess_datasets.py` to match paper specifications:
  - Exactly 2,000 samples per language for speech
  - Target 4.2s average duration 
  - Balanced sampling strategy
  - Consistent 22kHz sample rate

### 3. **Evaluation vs Training Modes** ✅
- **EVALUATION-ONLY**: Primary use case - measure bias without training
- **TRAINING**: Reference implementation for researchers
- Updated all documentation to clarify this distinction

## Usage Recommendations

### For Most Users (Bias Evaluation Focus):
```bash
# Download datasets
python Data/download_datasets.py --languages en es de fr vi th --hf_token $HF_TOKEN

# Preprocess with balanced sampling
python Data/preprocess_datasets.py --languages en es de fr vi th --create_splits

# Run bias evaluation (no training)
python run_benchmark.py --evaluation-only --domains speech --frontends mel erb bark

# Generate fairness reports
python Scripts/fairness_metrics.py --generate_report
```

### For Researchers (Full Pipeline):
```bash
# Full pipeline including training
python run_benchmark.py --domains speech --frontends mel erb bark gammatone cochlear learnable_mel
```

## Key Changes Made

1. **Data Scripts**: Updated to match reference implementation approach with:
   - HuggingFace integration for CommonVoice
   - Balanced sampling strategy from paper
   - Proper tonal/non-tonal language classification
   - Manual download guidance for restricted datasets

2. **Training Scripts**: Added clarifications that:
   - Primary purpose is evaluation, not training
   - Training is reference implementation only
   - Evaluation-only mode is recommended for most users

3. **Pipeline**: Added `--evaluation-only` mode for:
   - Faster bias measurement without training
   - Focus on core contribution (bias metrics)
   - Clear distinction between evaluation and training

4. **Documentation**: Updated to emphasize:
   - Evaluation framework as primary contribution
   - Training as secondary reference implementation
   - Clear usage patterns for different user types

## Balanced Dataset Creation ✅

The preprocessing script now implements the paper's balanced evaluation protocol:
- **Speech**: Exactly 2,000 samples per language, 4.2s average duration
- **Stratified sampling** to match target duration distribution
- **Reproducible splits** with fixed random seeds
- **Quality filtering** (duration, audio quality checks)

This ensures fair comparison across all cultural groups and eliminates volume bias that could affect the bias measurements.
